# üèó create-stylus

CLI to create decentralized applications (dapps) using Scaffold-Stylus.

This is an alternative method of installing Scaffold-Stylus. Instead of directly [cloning SS](https://github.com/Arb-Stylus/scaffold-stylus?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart), you can use create-stylus to create your own custom instance, where you can choose among several configurations and extensions.
